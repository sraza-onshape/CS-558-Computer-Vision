```python
# Pseudocode for Color-Based Segmentation

# Training Phase

# Step 1: Load labeled training data
training_images = load_training_images()
# building_masks = load_building_masks()  # Segmentation masks for the building
# foreground_masks = load_foreground_masks()  # Segmentation masks for the foreground object

# Step 2: Extract color features

def extract_color_features(image):
    # Implement color feature extraction
    # You might use HSV or other color spaces
    # Consider features such as color histograms or moments
    # Return a feature vector
    # ...

# Step 3: Train a segmentation model

def train_segmentation_model(training_images, building_masks, foreground_masks):
    # Implement training of a segmentation model
    # for each img in the building set
        # Use the extracted color features as input
        # Do mean shift clustering of the features
    # for each img in the building+object set
        # Use the extracted color features as input
        # Do mean shift clustering of the features
    # create a vBoW for each set, with k being +1 higher for the building+object set
    # 

# Step 4: Save the trained models

# Save the trained models for building and foreground object segmentation
save_model(train_segmentation_model(training_images, building_masks, foreground_masks), 'building_model.pkl')
save_model(train_segmentation_model(training_images, building_masks, foreground_masks), 'foreground_model.pkl')

# Testing Phase

# Step 5: Load the trained models
building_model = load_model('building_model.pkl')
foreground_model = load_model('foreground_model.pkl')

# Step 6: Segment a new image with both building and foreground object

def segment_new_image(image, building_model, foreground_model):
    # Extract color features from the new image
    features = extract_color_features(image)

    # Use the trained models to predict segmentation masks
    building_mask = building_model.predict(features)
    foreground_mask = foreground_model.predict(features)

    # Combine the segmentation masks
    combined_mask = building_mask & foreground_mask

    return combined_mask

# Step 7: Apply the segmentation to a new image

new_image = load_new_image()
segmentation_result = segment_new_image(new_image, building_model, foreground_model)

# Step 8: Post-processing (if needed)

# Implement any post-processing steps such as morphological operations to refine the segmentation result

# Display the original image and the segmentation result
display_images(new_image, segmentation_result)
